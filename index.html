    <p>Try to beat the AI cars!  All the blue cars are AI trained cars, and you are driving the red car.  W/A/S/D or arrow keys to drive.
      If you hit the wall too hard, you will have to start over again from the start, so drive carefully.<br>
    In case this does not work, make sure you are not on a mobile device and/or use Google Chrome.  To help it run better, enable "Use hardware acceleration when available" in Chrome settings.  <br>
      If you are still having problems, refer to this: https://superuser.com/questions/836832/how-can-i-enable-webgl-in-my-browser
